This telegram bot is created for personal usage mainly - to save memories I'm fond of and to train my skills.
But you can try it too! Or you can use my code for your project - either way I'll be flattered <3

It allows you to create 'events' of your meetings with friends and other people. Choose a place, add photos, write down funny moments.
Though you can input any human or place you'd like, the default variants are of my choice. Maybe someday I will add an ability to create a list of your own default people and places, but I can't see any sense in it right now. 

It also allows you to make a list of  books that you read and poems that you learnt by heart. I just like making lists 


Built on aiogram 3.x.x and aiogram-dialog library by Tishka17 (many thanks to authors of the libraries and to all contributors)

Gonna add the statistics block in the future so you (I) can see interesting numbers regarding my meetings. Just like you have in the end of the year in Social Networks or music apps.
